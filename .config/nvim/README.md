# Neovim
This subdirectory houses my neovim configurations.  Almost everything is directly sourced from
[NvChad](https://nvchad.com/), because I find it to be the neovim flavor with the most logical
out-of-box configurations and lots of nice tools.

I've made a few changes, mostly minor personal preferences (e.g. nerd font icon for branches, some
lsps & formatters, line at 100 chars in the editor, etc.).
